with the following subject:  LastName,FirstName - Midterm - Section#

Submit the solutions/program in a zipped folder.  
Do the best you can and turn in as much as you can.  

Note:  I just want one program for the solution to all the problems 
that follow. The program should prompt the user for which problem 
solution to display. Use a do-while and switch construct somewhat
like the following for the display of the menu and the selection of
which problem to run

	int inN;
        do{
         Menu();
         inN=getN();
         switch(inN){
          case 1:    problem1();break;
          case 2:    problem2();break;
          case 3:    problem3();break;
          case 4:    problem4();break;
          case 5:    problem5();break;
          case 6:    problem6();break;
          case 7:    problem7();break;
          default:   def(inN);}
        }while(inN<8);

Note:  I have provided a program that implements this format.
All of your homework should use a similar structure.


1)  Develop an application using structures for a customer
that will determine if he/she has exceeded his/her checking 
account balance. For each customer, the following 
facts are available:

a. Name
b. Address
c. Account number (Five digits only, i.e. test for this)
d. Balance at the beginning of the month 
e. Total of all checks written by this customer this month 
     Loop until customer is through entering checks.
f. Total of all deposits credited to this customer's account this 
     month.  Loop until customer is through entering deposits.

Dynamically create the structure.
The program should input each of these facts from input dialogs,
store in a structure, calculate the new balance, 
display the new balance and debit the account $15 if overdrawn. 
Also, if overdrawn, tell the customer the additional $15 fee 
has been accessed and what the balance would be with this fee included.
Make sure to output the contents of the structure.


2)  Develop an application using an array of structures that will 
determine the gross pay for any number of employees input. The company pays 
"straight-time" for the first 40 hours worked, double time for 
all hours worked in excess of 40 hours but less than 50 hours, 
and triple time for any hours worked over 50 hours.

The program should be able to loop and input the employee's name, 
hours worked, and the rate of pay.  Once this has been done then output
this information including the gross pay in the form of a paycheck.
The process starts all over 
again until you input an invalid rate of pay or hours worked.  This
means a negative rate of pay or negative number of hours worked is
not acceptable.

Paycheck
Company
Address
Name:	Amount: numerical
Amount: English
Signature:


3) Write a function using the following structure and prototype.

struct statsResult
{
    float avg;
    float median;
    int *mode;   //array containing the modes
    int nModes;  //number of modes in the array
    int maxFreq; //max frequency of modes
};

statsResult *avgMedMode(int *,int); 

The function takes in an integer array and the size of the array.
Then returns a pointer to a structure containing the average, median
and mode.  You will then write a printStat() function that will print
the results contained in the stats structure.  I will input a small 
array to test this out so ask for how many inputs to fill the array, 
then the values to place into the array.  Make sure you delete the 
dynamic array creation for the mode when you exit the problem.


4) A company wants to transmit data over the telephone, but they are 
concerned that their phones may be tapped. All of their data is 
transmitted as four-digit integers. However, they utilize the digits 
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 only. They have asked you to write a program that 
will encrypt their data so that it may be transmitted more securely.
Your application should read a four-digit integer with the numbers 
0 to 7 entered by the user in an input dialog and encrypt it as 
follows: Replace each digit by (the sum of that digit plus 5) modulus 8. 
Then swap the first digit with the second, and swap the third digit 
with the fourth. Then print the encrypted integer. Write a separate 
application that inputs an encrypted four-digit integer and decrypts 
it to form the original number.
Note:  sometimes errors occur and the digits 8, and 9 might appear.  
Detect this condition and flag the error.  Can't read in numbers 
individually.  All the digits must be read with one cin statement.


5)  a) Using a byte variable, what is the largest factorial that can 
be calculated.  A factorial is simply 

n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ... * (n-2) * (n-1) * n

For instance, 1! = 1,  2! = 2,  3! = 6,  4! = 24,  5! = 120 etc....

b)  What would be the largest factorial using short, int, long, float, 
double, etc...  Use all the primitive data types that you are familiar 
with signed as well as unsigned.

Note:  I want you to have fun investigating this and the program you 
turn in should just print "cout" the final results.  You don't know 
how to capture errors yet so run each till it overflows then back off by 1.
Don't need the program that tests for this.


6) a)  Convert the following 2 numbers to binary, octal and hex.
	2.125, 0.1328125
        When done, convert the following to a float representation
        by the definition in class. In other words, I want an 8 digit hex 
	number representation using the 4 byte float specification
        defined in class.  
   b)  Do the same for a) given they are negative values.
   c)  Convert the float representations of the following into 
	the decimal number given the definition in class.
	46666601, 46666602, B9999AFE

Note:  This doesn't require a program, however, I want you to write a 
simple function that outputs the answers you did by hand with "cout".

7) Factor an input integer into it's prime numbers.  Create a 
structure to hold the array of prime numbers.  Any number between
[2,10000] where n is not a prime > 100 will be a valid number to
check for prime factors.

struct Prime{
	unsigned char prime;
	unsigned char power;
};
struct Primes{
	Prime *prime;
	unsigned char nPrimes;
};
Output the number and it's primes -> 120 = 2^3*3^1*5^1
So create a function 
Primes *factor(int);-> Input an integer, return all prime factors
void prntPrm(Primes *); -> Output all prime factors
